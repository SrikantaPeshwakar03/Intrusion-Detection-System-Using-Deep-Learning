Real Time Intrusion Detection using Deep Learning Techniques
With the rapid expansion of the internet and increasing dependency on networked systems, network security has become a critical concern for organizations and individuals . Cyber attacks have grown in sophistication and frequency, posing significant threats to data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.To counter these threats, Intrusion Detection Systems(IDS) have been developed to monitor network traffic and identify malicious activities.
To enhance the performance of the Intrusion Detection System, we have implemented a Deep Learning Based Intrusion Detection System, using KDD CUP99 dataset.
